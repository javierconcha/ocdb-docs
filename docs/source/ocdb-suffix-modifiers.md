# Field name modifiers and suffixes

## Modifiers
The table below lists acceptable modifiers to modify field names. They must be appended after the base name (and wavelength, if any) but before any suffix.

| Field Modifiers |  Units |  Description  | 
|------------|--------|---------------|
| _###ang | does not change base field's units | Collection angle. Append '_###ang' to the end of a field name to indicate the collection angle a measurment (such as VSF) was taken at,  where '###' is replaced by the float or integer representation of an angle in degrees |
| _##cilo | does not change base field's units | Lower confidence interval, where ## is to be replaced with the percent the confidence interval was computed for |
| _##ciup | does not change base field's units | Upper confidence interval, where ## is to be replaced with the percent the confidence interval was computed for |
| _ex### | does not change base field's units | Excitation wavelength. Append '_ex###' to the end of a field name to indicate the wavelength of excitation the measurement was taken at, where '###' is replaced by the float or integer represenation of wavelength in nm. May be used in combination with '_em###', as such: '<field>_ex###_em###', where '_ex###' preceeds '_em###' |
| _em### | does not change base field's units | Emission wavelength. Append '_em###' to the end of a field name to indicate the wavelength of emission the measurement was taken at, where '###' is replaced by the float or integer represenation of wavelength in nm. May be used in combination with '_ex###', as such: '<field>_ex###_em###', where '_ex###' preceeds '_em###' |
| _###filt | does not change base field's units | Filter size current observed measurements are larger than, where ### is the number of micrometers of the filter size Unless this suffix is used, it is assumed the methodology used a standard filter size. May be used in combination with '###prefilt' , as such: '<field>_###filt_###prefilt)' |
| _###prefilt | does not change base field's units | Filter size current observed measurements are smaller than, where ### is the number of micrometers of the filter size. Unless this suffix is used, measurements are assumed to be from unfiltered or whole water.  May be used in combination with '###prefilt' , as such: '<field>_###filt_###prefilt)' |
| _###ppt | does not change base field's units | Parts per thousand, where ### indicates the solution's concentration that a measurement was taken in, as a floating point number or integer |
| _###size | does not change base field's units | Median bin diameter in microns. Used as a suffix for the field 'PSD' |
| _stokes1 | does not change base field's units | First Stokes parameter for characterizing polarization |
| _stokes2 | does not change base field's units | Second Stokes parameter for characterizing polarization |
| _stokes3 | does not change base field's units | Third Stokes parameter for characterizing polarization |
| _stokes4 | does not change base field's units | Fourth Stokes parameter for characterizing polarization |

## Suffixes
The table below lists acceptable suffixes to modify field names. They must be appended at the end of field name, after any modifiers or wavelength. For any field including a suffix, a corresponding field (without suffix) must exist (e.g. if Rrs442.5_sd is provided, Rrs442.5 must exist).

| Field Modifiers |  Units |  Description  | 
|------------|--------|---------------|
| _abun | cell/L | Cell abundance for a particular (phytoplankton) taxonomic type | 
| _biovol | m^3/L | Bio-volume for a particular (phytoplankton) taxonomic type | 
| _carbon | ug/L | Carbon concentration for a particular (phytoplankton) taxonomic type | 
| _bincount | none | Number of records averaged into a bin or reported measurement specific to the prefix that _bincount is attached to. The field bincount can simply be used if the bincount applies to all forms of data in the file but this field suffix (i.e. '<field>_bincount') can be used multiple times in the same file for field-specific numbers. | 
| _cv | unitless | Coefficient of Variation |  
| _sd | same as base field's units | Standard Deviation | 
| _se | same as base field's units | Standard Error | 
| _qa | none | added by OCDB staff, it is set to True when measurement pass internal quality checked and will be considered for matchups |
